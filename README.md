# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client, The Gaming Room, requested a design for their multi-user game application, Draw It or Lose It. The game, originally built for Android systems, is loosely based on the 1980s television show Win, Lose or Draw. It involves teams guessing a puzzle based on images, and the goal was to expand it to multiple operating platforms while ensuring efficient performance in terms of memory and storage management.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I believe that I did well in breaking down the client’s technical needs into specific, manageable components. I also ensured that the documentation was thorough yet concise, clearly laying out the requirements for both the software and how it would function across different platforms.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The design document process forced me to think critically about the structure and flow of the application before diving into coding. It helped identify potential challenges, such as cross-platform compatibility and resource management, early on.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I were to revise one part, it would be the section on platform-specific optimizations. I would improve it by conducting more in-depth research on memory and storage management techniques specific to iOS, Windows, and other operating systems to provide more targeted recommendations for each platform.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user’s needs by focusing on smooth, real-time gameplay performance and ensuring the application could handle multiple simultaneous games efficiently. This was achieved by optimizing memory usage and ensuring scalable storage solutions. Considering the user’s needs is crucial because it drives the design decisions that directly impact user experience, ensuring the software meets performance expectations and usability.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
My approach was to first understand the client’s goals and the technical requirements of the application. I utilized a combination of agile planning and modular design, breaking down the software into manageable components. In the future, I would continue to emphasize early identification of bottlenecks through design documents and involve iterative testing to validate performance across different platforms, ensuring scalability and user satisfaction.
